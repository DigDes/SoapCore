# SoapCore

SOAP protocol middleware for ASP.NET Core

Based on Microsoft article: [Custom ASP.NET Core Middleware Example](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/19/custom-asp-net-core-middleware-example/).

Support ref\out params, exceptions. Works with legacy SOAP\WCF-clients.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

The following frameworks are supported:

- .NET Core 3.1 (using ASP.NET Core 3.0)
- .NET Core 3.0 (using ASP.NET Core 3.0)
- .NET Core 2.1 (using ASP.NET Core 2.1)
- .NET Standard 2.0 (using ASP.NET Core 2.1)

.NET Core 2.2 / ASP.NET Core 2.2 is not explictly supported, but will probably work. We suggest upgrading to .NET Core 3.0 since .NET Core 2.2 is only supported until December 23, 2019.
If you using .NET Framework, and you cannot migrate to .NET Core, we recommend downgrading to ASP.net Core 2.1 since it's an LTS release and will be supported for some time.

### Installing

`PM> Install-Package SoapCore`

There's 2 diferent ways of adding SoapCore to your ASP.net Core website. If you are using ASP.NET Core 3.0 or higher with endpoint routing enabled (the default):

In Startup.cs:


```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSoapCore();
    services.TryAddSingleton<ServiceContractImpl>();
    services.AddMvc();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
{
	app.UseRouting();
	
	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => {
		endpoints.UseSoapEndpoint<ServiceContractImpl>("/ServicePath.asmx", new BasicHttpBinding());
	});
    
}
```

If you are using ASP.NET Core 2.1 (i.e., on .NET Framework, .NET Core 2.1, or another .NET Standard 2.0 compliant platform):

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSoapCore();
    services.TryAddSingleton<ServiceContractImpl>();
    services.AddMvc();
}
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
{
    app.UseSoapEndpoint<ServiceContractImpl>("/ServicePath.asmx", new BasicHttpBinding());
}
```

Program.cs
```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var host = new WebHostBuilder()
        .UseKestrel()
        .UseUrls("http://*:5050")
        .UseStartup<Startup>()
        .Build();
    host.Run();
}
```

### Using with legacy WCF/WS

It is possible to use SoapCore with .net legacy WCF and Web Services, both as client and service.

Primary point here is to use XmlSerializer and properly markup messages and operations with xml serialization attributes. You may use legacy pre-generated wrappers to obtain these contracts or implement them manualy. Extended example is available under serialization tests project.

### Tips and Tricks

#### Extending the pipeline

In your ConfigureServices method, you can register some additional items to extend the pipeline:
* services.AddSoapMessageInspector() - add a custom MessageInspector. These function similarly to the `IDispatchMessageInspector` in WCF. The newer `IMessageInspector2` interface allows you to register multiple inspectors, and to know which service was being called.
* services.AddSingleton<MyOperatorInvoker>() - add a custom OperationInvoker. Similar to WCF's `IOperationInvoker` this allows you to override the invoking of a service operation, commonly to add custom logging or exception handling logic around it.

#### How to get custom HTTP header in SoapCore service

Use interface IServiceOperationTuner to tune each operation call.

Create class that implements IServiceOperationTuner.
Parameters in Tune method:
* httpContext - current HttpContext. Can be used to get http headers or body.
* serviceInstance - instance of your service.
* operation - information about called operation.

```csharp
public class MyServiceOperationTuner : IServiceOperationTuner
{
    public void Tune(HttpContext httpContext, object serviceInstance, SoapCore.OperationDescription operation)
    {
        if (operation.Name.Equals("SomeOperationName"))
        {
            MyService service = serviceInstance as MyService;
            string result = string.Empty;

            StringValues paramValue;
            if (httpContext.Request.Headers.TryGetValue("some_parameter", out paramValue))
            {
                result = paramValue[0];
            }

            service.SetParameterForSomeOperation(result);
        }
    }
}
```

Register MyServiceOperationTunre in Startup class:

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // ...
        services.AddSoapServiceOperationTuner(new MyServiceOperationTuner());
        //...
    }
    // ...
}
```

Change your service to get possibility to store information from http header:

```csharp
public class MyService : IMyServiceService
{
    // Use ThreadLocal or some of thread sinchronization stuff if service registered as singleton.
    private ThreadLocal<string> _paramValue = new ThreadLocal<string>() { Value = string.Empty };

    // ...
    
    public void SetParameterForSomeOperation(string paramValue)
    {
        _paramValue.Value = paramValue;
    }

    public string SomeOperationName()
    {
        return "Param value from http header: " + _paramValue.Value;
    }
}
```
